          <p><strong>#1.1</strong> (Aella): "Fwiw I consider someone an (aspiring) rationalist mostly if they've read the sequences and make some ongoing effort to practice the art of rationality in their daily life.
            Ppl often practice at meetups, so it's correlated, but meetup attendance does not a rationalist make"</p>
